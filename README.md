Hi Olumoye Wisdom,

Hope you’re doing well too

Please find attached the requested zipped files containing:

1. Full source code (frontend & backend) for both admin and user app and a single zip containing source code for BE (Server setup and database)
2. Server login details (SSH, control panel) — stored in the "server_credentials.txt" inside the zip.
3. Database access credentials and a recent backup file.
4. API keys and configuration files for the app (secured in the "config" folder).
5. Push notification setup documentation.
6. App Store & Play Store build files (.aab, .apk, .ipa).
7. Any other required dependencies and documentation for running the app.

Everything is organized in labeled folders inside the zip for easier navigation.  
If you need any clarification on the files or setup, let me know and I’ll walk you through it.

Best regards,
